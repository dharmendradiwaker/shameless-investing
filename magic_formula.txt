# Magic Formula -

Earning Yield = it showes the cheapness of stock in valuation prefrence.
The Higher the Earning yield means cheaper the company price.

Earning yield = EBIT(earning before interest tax)/ Enterprise Value

Enterprise value = (Market Capitalization + Debt) - Cash Equivelent

# Identitifation of Good companies 
To identify the good company we can use the ROC(Return on capital).The more higher the Return
on capital is more efficient the company.

ROC = EDIT/ (Net Fixed Assets + Net Working Capital)

*Multiple with 100 to get the result in %.

Net Working capital = current assests - current liailities
